Most people have no idea what depression really is. Although it affects more than 350 million people
worldwide. Therefore, in our project, we tried to raise more awareness about depression. Our design idea is to use a
survey method to evaluate the possibility of having depression according to data from HP2020 Objective.
In our opening, first, we dynamically present some surprising fact numbers about depression. We hope
this depression introduction part can give people a brief understanding of this mental disorder. In the
survey part, we have 10 questions with variables that affect the rate of depression. A progress bar will
show the rate changing according to the survey user’s selection. Some selections will increase your rate
of having depression while some may reduce it. By showing the final possibility of developing depression,
we want to increase people’s attention about this illness.
